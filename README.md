# 👋 Hi, I'm Pranav

I'm a full-stack developer who enjoys building websites, apis, and dev tools. I focus on TypeScript, Node.js, and developer experience—but I’ll dive into any stack that solves the problem well.

## 🛠️ My Stack

**Languages:** TypeScript, JavaScript, Python

**My Favourite Technologies:**

- Next.js (React) (TypeScript)
- Express (TypeScript), Fastify (TypeScript)
- FastAPI (The Best Python Backend Framework)
- Ruff (RRIR Fan) (Oxidize Everything)
- Docker
- GitHub Actions
- Cloud Run (Proud to say my APIs have cost me $0 to host)
- MongoDB, Firebase, PostgreSQL

**Currently Exploring:**  
Fastify, TAP (Node testing), Cloud Deploy, CLI tooling

## 🔭 Projects & Highlights

- **Timeey** – Employee time tracking tool built in partnership with a Kumon branch
- **Linkit2** - Open source link shortener
- **HustleAuto** - Website for a Car Detailing Business

💬 Ask me about

- The latest JS library I'm using
- Why auto-sorting imports is peak developer happiness
- That magical moment when all tests pass after cloning an old project
- How many times I've set up formatting, linting, pre-commit hooks, devcontainers (...or maybe don't)
- Building forms in React (seriously, I’ve done a lot of them)

## 📚 Recent Tech Notes & Experiments

I like taking notes while I build. These help me (and sometimes others) learn faster:
